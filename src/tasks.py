        You are an AI assistant responsible for generating executable Python code that performs specific tasks using the provided file paths. 
        Your generated code must be structured, optimized, and ready to run in a Python compiler without modification.

        IMPORTANT:
        - The code should use exactly these file paths:
            * Input file: "D:/work/gramener/anand_assignment/project1/tds_project1_automation_agent/data/dates.txt"
            * Output file: "D:/work/gramener/anand_assignment/project1/tds_project1_automation_agent/data/dates-wednesdays.txt"
        - Do not modify these paths; use them exactly as given.
        - The generated code must handle file reading and writing correctly.
        - The code should efficiently process the dates and count only the number of Wednesdays.
        - Only a single integer (the result) should be written to the output file.
        - Include proper exception handling for missing or malformed data.
        - No extra text should be outputâ€”only the Python code.
        - The generated code must define a function named "count_wednesdays" that takes two parameters: input_file and output_file.

        Example Task:
        The file "D:/work/gramener/anand_assignment/project1/tds_project1_automation_agent/data/dates.txt" contains one date per line in the format YYYY-MM-DD. 
        Your task is to count the number of Wednesdays in this file and write just the integer count to "D:/work/gramener/anand_assignment/project1/tds_project1_automation_agent/data/dates-wednesdays.txt".

        prompt = f"""Hereâ€™s a refined and strict version of your prompt to ensure accurate function selection based on user tasks:  

            ---

            **Prompt:**  
            You are an AI engine that understands user-provided tasks and helps automate processes by returning the most relevant function(s) to execute them. Your goal is to strictly map the task to one or more function names from the predefined list.  

            ### **Example Tasks and Expected Function Mapping:**  
            - **A2.** Format the contents of `/data/format.md` using `prettier@3.4.2`, updating the file in-place â†’ **`format_markdown_task`**  
            - **A3.** Count the number of Wednesdays in `/data/dates.txt` and write the result to `/data/dates-wednesdays.txt` â†’ **`count_weekdays_task`**  
            - **A4.** Sort contacts in `/data/contacts.json` by `last_name`, then `first_name`, and write the result to `/data/contacts-sorted.json` â†’ **`sort_contacts_task`**  
            - **A5.** Extract the first line of the 10 most recent `.log` files in `/data/logs/` and save it to `/data/logs-recent.txt` â†’ **`logs_recent_task`**  
            - **A6.** Find all Markdown (`.md`) files in `/data/docs/`, extract the first occurrence of each H1 header, and create `/data/docs/index.json` mapping filenames to titles â†’ **`index_docs_task`**  
            - **A7.** Extract the senderâ€™s email from `/data/email.txt` and write it to `/data/email-sender.txt` â†’ **`extract_email_task`**  
            - **A8.** Extract a credit card number from `/data/credit-card.png`, remove spaces, and save it to `/data/credit-card.txt` â†’ **`credit_card_task`**  
            - **A9.** Find the most similar pair of comments in `/data/comments.txt` using embeddings and save them to `/data/comments-similar.txt` â†’ **`comments_similarity_task`**  
            - **A10.** Calculate total sales for "Gold" tickets in `/data/ticket-sales.db` and write the number to `/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt` â†’ **`ticket_sales_task`**  

            ### **Function Names:**   
            - `format_markdown_task`  
            - `count_weekdays_task`  
            - `sort_contacts_task`  
            - `logs_recent_task`  
            - `index_docs_task`  
            - `extract_email_task`  
            - `credit_card_task`  
            - `comments_similarity_task`  
            - `ticket_sales_task`   

            ### **Strict Matching Rules:**  
            1. **Accurate Mapping:** The function(s) returned must precisely match the nature of the task. No extra or unrelated functions should be included.  
            2. **No Overlap:** If a task clearly aligns with a single function, return only that function. If multiple functions are required, return only the necessary ones.  
            3. **Clear Outputs:** The response should **only** contain a **list of function names** without explanations, additional text, or formatting errors.  
            4. **Task Coverage:** Ensure that all tasks align with the provided function set.
